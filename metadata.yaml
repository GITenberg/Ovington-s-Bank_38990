description: Explore a fascinating period in history with this detailed and engaging
  historical novel from prominent author Stanley J. Weyman. The novel unfolds against
  the backdrop of the Panic of 1825, a crash that was caused in part by a massive
  fraud set in Poyais, a made-up country in Latin America. Weyman masterfully weaves
  the financial shockwave caused by this series of events into a tale that highlights
  how the panic impacted real, salt-of-the-earth people.
